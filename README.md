# pieces_parts
these are pieces_parts styled information. This is the major backdrop of the game's code and data base. Here you will find header files, bitmap files, image files, text files and maybe even password files that will braek the game for you if you save with them on. This is where the goods will be but for the most part it will not be for matted for you. You can use it as a learning point if you desire. I WOULD recommend it. There will also be lots of lore and imagery and soundsmanship that you may not get a chance to encounter in your regular run of the game. I do not know the file size limits around here but feel free to up load if you would like your piece to go into the game somehow. Less work for me. Just make sure to mark them "_UNREAD_filename", without the quotes. Peace.
